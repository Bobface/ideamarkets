Idea Markets

I'd like to build a curation market that works like reddit, only submissions are ranked by market cap rather than by upvotes.

User journey:

1) User submits link to existing tweet
2) Tweet content immortalized on ETH blockchain, bonding curve token established for that particular tweet
3) Users buy/sell tokens for each tweet (using ETH or DAI), tweets ranked by USD equivalent market cap

Buy/sell curve is asymmetrical, so people always buy at a slight premium and sell at a slight loss (see image: )

THAT'S IT!

Tools to make this as easy as possible:
1. Easy-onboarding web wallet: Portis.io
2. Alpha code: https://github.com/ConsenSys/curationmarkets
3. Intro to curation markets: https://medium.com/@simondlr/introducing-curation-markets-trade-popularity-of-memes-information-with-code-70bf6fed9881


Future versions:

The platform pools the profits in a reserve and distributes to token holders according to market cap (like Uniswap with liquidity pools)
"Sub-markets" (like subreddits) can be created to rank tweets for any topic
